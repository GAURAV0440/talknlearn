      " Saved Mistakes:\n",
      "\n",
      "ID: 1 | Input: hii i am gaurav | Correction: The sentence has a few mistakes. \"hii\" is informal English and should be \"Hi\" or \"Hello\".  \"i\" needs to be capitalized as \"I\".  \"am\" is the English word for \"to be\".  In German, \"to be\" is \"sein\", and conjugated for \"I\", it's \"bin\".  \"Gaurav\" is your name and remains unchanged. The correct sentence in German is: \"Hallo, ich bin Gaurav.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "ID: 2 | Input: hii i am gaurav | Correction: The sentence \"hii i am gaurav\" has a few issues when translating to Spanish.  \"hii\" is an informal English greeting, and \"i am\" translates to \"soy\" when stating your name.  Capitalization is also important for proper names. The correct Spanish translation is \"Hola, soy Gaurav.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "ID: 3 | Input: Yo es bien, gracias. Y tú? | Correction: The main issue is with \"Yo es bien\".  The correct way to say \"I am well\" is \"Yo estoy bien\".  \"Es\" comes from the verb \"ser\" (to be) which is used for permanent or inherent characteristics.  \"Estoy\" comes from the verb \"estar\" (to be) which is used for temporary states like how you're feeling. Also, \"bien\" means \"well\" while \"bueno/buena/buenos/buenas\" means \"good.\"  In this context, \"bien\" is the better choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "ID: 4 | Input: hii i am gaurav | Correction: The sentence \"hii i am gaurav\" has a few issues.  \"Hii\" is an informal English greeting, and \"i am\" should be capitalized. In Spanish, you'd say \"Hola, soy Gaurav\" (Hi, I'm Gaurav) or \"Hola, me llamo Gaurav\" (Hi, my name is Gaurav).\n",
      "\n",
      "ID: 5 | Input: Hola, me es Gaurav. Estoy bueno. | Correction: There are a couple of things here.  \"Me es Gaurav\" is not the correct way to introduce yourself.  You should say \"Me llamo Gaurav\" (My name is Gaurav) or \"Soy Gaurav\" (I am Gaurav). Also, \"Estoy bueno\" means \"I am good\" in the sense of well-behaved or tasty (like a good meal). To say you are well (feeling good), you'd use \"Estoy bien\".\n",
      "\n",
      "ID: 6 | Input: hi i am gaurav | Correction: The sentence \"hi i am gaurav\" is a good start, but to translate it into Spanish, we need to use the correct vocabulary and grammar.  \"Hi\" can be translated as \"Hola\". \"I am\" is \"soy\" or \"me llamo\".  While you can say \"Soy Gaurav\", using \"Me llamo Gaurav\" (My name is Gaurav) is more common when introducing yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "ID: 7 | Input: Hola, me es Gaurav. Estoy bueno. | Correction: There are a couple of mistakes.  \"Me es\" is used to express possession or something relating to you, like \"Me es importante\" (It's important to me). To introduce yourself, you should use \"Soy\" (I am).  Also, \"Estoy bueno\" means \"I am good\" in the sense of well-being or moral character. To say you are well, you'd use \"Estoy bien\".  So the correct sentence is \"Hola, soy Gaurav. Estoy bien.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "ID: 8 | Input: Yo es bien, gracias. | Correction: The mistake is in the verb \"ser\" (to be).  You used \"es\" (he/she/it is), but with the pronoun \"yo\" (I), you need to use \"soy\" (I am).  Also, \"bien\" means \"well\" but is usually used with \"estar\" (to be, for temporary states).  To say \"I am well,\" the most common way is \"Estoy bien.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "ID: 9 | Input: hi i am gaurav | Correction: Hallo, ich bin Gaurav.\n",
